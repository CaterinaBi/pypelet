# Pypelet - A large multilingual corpus of spoken interactions in the Romance languages.

A cooperative project that utilises NLP techniques for the creation of an open-source corpus of spoken interactions in Romance, and a user-friendly platform to access it.

The project is set to start in March 2023, as I am currently seeking funds to support it. 

A call for collaborators will be published shortly before that time.
